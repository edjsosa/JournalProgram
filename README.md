# Journal App
The Journal App is a console application that allows users to write and store journal entries, search for entries by date range or keyword, and save and load journal data to and from a file. The application was developed using C# and the .NET Framework.

## Installation
To run the Journal App, you need to have the .NET Framework installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the .NET Framework from the Microsoft website. Once you have installed the .NET Framework, you can download or clone the Journal App source code from the repository on GitHub.

## Usage
To start the Journal App, open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project. Then, run the program from the console. The application will display a main menu with the following options:

1. Write a new journal entry
2. Display all journal entries
3. Search for entries by date range
4. Search for entries by keyword
5. Save journal to a file
6. Load journal from a file
7. Exit

Select an option by entering the corresponding number.

If you select option 1, the application will generate a random prompt for you to respond to. You can then enter your response and save the entry to the journal.

If you select option 2, the application will display all journal entries that have been saved.

If you select option 3, the application will ask you to enter a start and end date for the date range you want to search for. The application will then display all entries that fall within that range.

If you select option 4, the application will ask you to enter a keyword to search for. The application will then display all entries that contain the keyword.

If you select option 5, the application will ask you to enter a filename to save the journal to. The application will then save the journal data to a JSON file.

If you select option 6, the application will ask you to enter the filename of the journal file to load. The application will then load the journal data from the file.

If you select option 7, the application will exit.
